This project was represent an implementation of the mandatory assignment
in the course TDT4215 Web-intelligence, spring 2012, at Norwegian
University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

We have implemented a search system that uses the patient record notes
as a search query to the therapy chapters of the Norwegian electronic
handbook for pharmaceutical intervention (legemiddelh√•ndboka).

The system and its results are described in a report and a presentation.
