Slide 1: Welcome
-----------------
Good day. My name is Even, over there is Terje and Weilin.
We are group 1, and this is our presentation.


Slide 2: System architecture
-----------------------------
Lets talk about system architecture.

First, Whoosh. Indexing and searching for task 1 and 2.

We decided early ... to store to disk as JSON.

data.py contains classes representing input ... methods for storing to and from JSON.

parse.py .. icd10 with a standard XML parser. therapy chapters with a custom HTML parser we wrote.

preprocessed to convert everything to UTF-8.

tasks.py implements the different tasks in the project, with a function for each.

Slide 7: Improvement based on result evaluation
------------------------------------------------
Lets talk about result evaluation.

We simply defined a set of words as relevant medical terms. Manually.
If both a patient case and a therapy chapter contained one of these words,
we deemed the chapter to be a relevant result.

Crude, but sufficient to allow automatic evaluation.

With automatic evaluation we were able to tweak individual parts of our
system and see how it affected the end results. It gave us feedback
for manually optimizing the classification algorithm. But it could also
be used for automatic optimizations.

We calculated precision at 10 documents seen and R-precision, and as you
can see our results are very good based in this evaluation method.
