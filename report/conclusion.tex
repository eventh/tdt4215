Through several search and retrieval tasks we have learned how algorithms and approaches determine what results we get, and how good these results are. This assignment demonstrates the importance of incorporating multiple mathematic measures to give the best set of relevant results. In addition, we have seen that our information retrieval systems works best if it is provided with several sources of information. We achieved the best result when we used information from the ICD-10 codes, ATC codes and therapy chapters to classify treatment for the patient cases.
