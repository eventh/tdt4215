Through several search and retrieval tasks we have learned how algorithms and approaches determine what results we get, and how good these results are. This assignment demonstrates the importance of incorporating multiple mathematic measures to give the best set of relevant results. In addition, we have seen that our information retrieval systems works best if it is provided with several sources of information. We achieved the best result when we combined results from the tasks for the ICD-10 codes, ATC codes and therapy chapters to classify treatment for the patient cases.

A well known management adage is ``You can't manage what you don't measure''. This implies the importance of evaluating results. As described in the report, we used both manual and automatic evaluation to measure how good the results were. We quickly realized the huge benefits of doing this automatically, but we also understood the difficulties. We believe that automatic evaluation will never be as good as the evaluation done manually by an expert of the domain. 

We can conclude that the algorithms we have used are sound, and that they solve the search and retrieval of the tasks in the assignment.
