\section{Limitations}
One obvious limitation to the assignment was that only approved libraries could be used to solve the tasks. This point was up for negotiation, and other libraries could be used if approved by the staff. The students would start out by looking at the limited set of choices, and most probably choose one of the suggested. This limitation might have served a good cause; leading the students in to well know libraries that were sure to work for the given tasks.
