This paper documents the mandatory group assignment in TDT4215 Web-intelligence
at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

The assignment asks us to implement a search system that utilizes patient
record notes as a search query to therapy chapters of a Norwegian electronic
handbook for pharmaceutical interventions (Legemiddelh√•ndboka), which can
assist practitioners in efficient and precise searching and enhance keywords
based search interfaces.

The paper is structured as follows:
\hyperref[cha:architecture]{Chapter \ref*{cha:architecture}} describes the
architecture of our system.
\hyperref[cha:method]{Chapter \ref*{cha:method}} explains methods used to
solve the project tasks, while \autoref{cha:result} presents results.
\hyperref[cha:discussion]{Chapter \ref*{cha:discussion}} provides a discussion
of the results, while \autoref{cha:conclusion} concludes the paper.
Stopwords, medical terms and patient cases are listed in the
\hyperref[appendix]{Appendix}.
